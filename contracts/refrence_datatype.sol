refrence datatype-> String, Arrays, Mappings, Struct

-> if we use a refrence dataype we always have to explicitly provide the data area where the type is stored.

-> every ref datatype has an additional annoatation the "data location" , about where it is stored. 
there are three data locations: 1. memory, 2.storage 3. calldata 

1. memory:- lifetime is limited to an external function call
2. storage:- to locations where the state variables are stored , where the lifetime is limited to the lifetime of a contract
3. calldata:- special data loacations that contains the function argumnts
